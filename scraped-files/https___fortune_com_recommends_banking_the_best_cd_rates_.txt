Customers can opt for a partial withdrawal of their funds—though this could mean missing out on some compound interest. You can access FNBA’s customer service via phone or online request. .table-container table, td, th {border: 1px solid #111111;}.table-container table {max-width: 600px;margin: auto;width: 100%;margin-bottom: 24px;font-family: 'Graphik Condensed', Arial Narrow, Helvetica neue Condensed, sans-serif;border-collapse: collapse;}.table-container table th {padding: 16px;background-color: #00CD98;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 600;line-height: 28.8px;}.table-container table tbody tr {background-color: #FFFFFF;}.table-container table tbody tr:first-child td {font-size: 16px;font-weight: 600;line-height: 19.2px;padding: 8px 16px;}.table-container table tbody tr td {padding: 16px;}.table-container table tbody tr td a {color: #007B9D;text-decoration: none;}.table-container table tbody tr td a:hover {color: #666666;}.table-container tr:first-of-type {background-color: #33CC99 !important;} About:  Headquartered in Maryland, CFG bank was founded in 2009.

Review our full list of  the best 5-year CD rates . What you should know about CDs  With CDs, customers receive a fixed interest rate in exchange for tying up their money for a fixed period.  After a CD reaches maturity—or the end of its term—you can withdraw the money you deposited initially, plus any earned interest. Some CDs are penalty-free, so customers can withdraw funds before the term ends, but most CDs charge a penalty that’s usually worth a few days or months of interest.  Read our  complete guide to certificates of deposit . A CD ladder is a savings strategy where you invest in several CDs with varying maturities. This way, you’ll benefit from higher rates on longer-term CDs, while still keeping some of your funds accessible in the near term. We’ll walk you though  how to build a CD ladder . A CD may be the best banking choice for you if you are saving for a long-term goal with a specific timeline in mind. To avoid early withdrawal penalties or potentially forfeiting any interest earned on the funds in your CD, you want to be sure that you won’t need access to your money before your CD’s maturity date.  Certificates of deposit are considered safe investments so long as they are helped by FDIC- or NCUA-insured financial institutions which insure your deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank, for each account ownership category or up to $250,000 per share owner, per insured credit union, for each account ownership category.  The minimum balance for a CD will depend on your financial institution. There is no set minimum across the board. However, most institutions will require a minimum deposit between $500 and $1,000. Some may require higher or lower opening deposits.  To calculate your earnings from a CD, you’ll need to  use the following formula: A = P(1+R/N) (NT) . Where ‘A’ represents the value of your CD, including interest. ‘P’ is equal to your principal balance or initial deposit. ‘R’ represents your yearly interest rate, in this case it would be your APY. ‘N’ represents the compound frequency of your CD in a given year, and ‘T’ represents the number of years until your CD’s maturity date.  CDs offer many advantages for savers, including higher APYs and fixed rates, which may offer greater returns over time. Additionally, CDs are offered in a variety of terms, making it a viable option for savers with short- and long-term goals.  CDs don’t offer the same liquidity as other savings accounts. Should you need to access your funds, you’ll likely be charged a penalty for doing so. Additionally, your overall returns upon your CD’s maturity date could be impacted if the inflation rate increases at a faster pace than your interest earnings.  This type of CD does not charge a penalty for withdrawing funds before your CD reaches maturity. This type of CD is less common than other CD types and may also offer lower APYs than traditional CDs.  Brokered CDs are purchased and sold through a brokerage account, rather than through a traditional banking institution and may offer higher APYS than CDs offered by banks.  Jump CDs are CDs that allow you to upgrade or “jump” to a higher rate should the rate on your CD term increase after you’ve opened your account.  As long as you meet the membership requirements needed to join a credit union and verify that the financial institutions you’re considering are FDIC or NCUA members, both  banks and credit unions  offer similar products, including CDs. Rates will vary across the board.  When you invest in a CD, you typically deposit one lump sum and then leave it alone until the account reaches maturity. However, some financial institutions offer special types of “add-on” CDs that allow you to deposit additional funds after the initial deposit. The amount and frequency of deposits you’re allowed to make depend on the particular account. Generally speaking, long-term CDs offer higher interest rates than short-term CDs. This is because banks reward you with a higher return for committing your money for a longer period of time. The drawback is that while you may earn more interest with a long-term CD, your money will also be tied up for a longer period. If it turns out you need your money sooner and withdraw it before the CD matures, you’ll have to pay an early withdrawal penalty, which eats into your earnings. However, the current economic environment can also affect CD rates. In periods of rising interest rates, shorter-term CDs can become more attractive because you can reinvest the funds more frequently at higher rates. This is sometimes referred to as a “CD ladder” strategy, where you stagger the maturity dates of your CDs to balance the benefits of short-term and long-term CDs. Overall, whether it’s better to choose a short-term or long-term CD depends on your goals, as well as the current interest rate environment.  A “good” CD rate can be somewhat subjective. That’s because you need to strike a balance between the best rate available and the longest amount of time you can afford to keep your money tied up. For example, if you find a CD offering 5% APY, but it requires you to keep your money on deposit for five years, the interest rate may not be worth it. You might need your money sooner, or rates could go higher while you’re stuck earning a lower return.  Generally, a CD rate that’s above the national average is a solid choice. Before opening a CD, compare accounts from multiple banks and see which one offers the highest rate for the term length you want. CD rates are the highest they’ve been in years. So yes, it’s a good time to put your money in a CD. However, you’ll want to be careful about choosing a term length that’s too long. The Fed has indicated that it isn’t done raising rates, and chances are that  CD rates will continue to go up . So if you do lock your money into a CD, aim for a term of two years or less. Our methodology The Fortune Recommends TM  team compared certificates of deposit (CDs) from more than 45 major banks, credit unions, and online-only banks that offered one-, three-, and five-year CD terms. Our top picks are available to customers across the U.S. no matter where you’re located, subject to the terms of each CD.  For our best overall CD rates, we ranked the best overall CDs on the following categories and weighted each category as outlined in the percentages below: We think the best CDs offer APYs twice the  national average  for one-year, three-year, and five-year terms. We didn’t include brokered CDs on our list, which are riskier because they are sold on the secondary market through brokerages.  CD rates, fees, and minimum deposit requirements may be limited-time offers, and APYs are subject to change. The FDIC or NCUA insures all the banks and credit unions on this list. Terminating your CD before it matures may incur a penalty fee, which varies by bank and credit union.
