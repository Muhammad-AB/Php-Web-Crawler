ZYNLO offers just three accounts: savings, money market, and checking. The ZYNLO money market account made our list because it had a high 5.00% APY, $10 minimum deposit, and no monthly maintenance fees. Another notable benefit of this account is that there are no monthly withdrawal limits, unlike some of the other banks on our list. The one drawback? ZYNLO doesn’t offer check or debit card access with its money market accounts. What is a money market account? A money market account is like a combination between  a checking account  and a savings account. These accounts typically offer higher APYs than checking accounts and, in many cases, identical features—check-writing abilities, debit card access, and the ability to make withdrawals and deposits via ATM.  However, unlike checking accounts, there may be a limit on the number of withdrawals—usually six—made from your money market account each month. And not all money market accounts come with all the features mentioned above. It’s also not unusual for money market accounts to be tiered, offering higher APYs on higher balances. There may also be a minimum opening deposit or a balance you must maintain to avoid paying maintenance fees. Before opening a money market account, it’s essential to shop around and research APYs, fees, and other features to ensure you find the best account fit for your finances. How to pick a money market account When deciding between money market accounts, you’ll want to consider various account features such as: 3 factors to look for when choosing a money market account  While there may be certain aspects of a MMA that are more important to you, here are a few key features that you’ll want to pay special attention to when narrowing down your list:  Money market accounts vs. savings accounts vs. CDs  Money market accounts and savings accounts have many similarities. Think of a money market as a hybrid between a savings account and a checking account. Like a savings account and a CD, the money in your MMA will earn interest and your balance will grow over time. However, unlike a CD, you can withdraw money from your MMA the same way you would from your checking or savings account, and in most cases, you won’t incur a penalty unless you’ve hit your withdrawal limit for the month.  Similar to a savings account, APYs on money market accounts are not fixed and can fluctuate day to day, whereas  CDs  offer a fixed rate in exchange for locking up your money for a set amount of time with zero liquidity.  Frequently asked questions about MMAs  A  money market account  is similar to a  checking account  and a savings account. These accounts typically offer higher APYs than checking accounts and often have check-writing and debit card privileges. When choosing a money market account, you should consider the account’s APY, maintenance fees, minimum balance requirements, check-writing and debit card privileges, and withdrawal limits. Your money is safe in a money market account if your bank or credit union is insured by the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  (FDIC) or  National Credit Union Administration  (NCUA), respectively. These organizations insure your deposits of up to $250,000 per account in the unlikely event of  bank failure . Your individual bank or credit union determines money market account APYs and may fluctuate in response to macroeconomic changes, changes to the federal funds rate, and more. Any interest earned on your money market account balance is considered taxable income and is reported to the IRS on Form 1099-INT. No. Money market accounts are deposit accounts offered by your bank or credit union that are liquid and federally insured. Money market funds are a type of mutual fund that invests in debt securities and may pay a small amount of interest on a monthly basis. These funds are not federally insured. Many money market accounts offer debit cards, but not all do. Check with your financial institution to confirm that your MMA has a debit card. Many money market accounts offer check-writing privileges, although some financial institutions may charge an additional fee for ordering checks.
